# OEIS Analysis

First and foremost, thanks to **The Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences** ([oeis.org](oeis.org)) for providing a large database of interesting multiplicative functions to study.

Installation instructions and potentially documentation will come at a later date, when the project has proven to be doable.

The essential idea of this project is to take all the 1458 multiplicative functions featured on OEIS, and calculate their *tannakian symbol* (unpublished work), and use these to look for identities and potentially other interesting aspects.
